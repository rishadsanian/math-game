# 2-Player math game where players take turns to answer simple math addition problems. A new math question is generated for each turn by picking two numbers between 1 and 20. The player whose turn it is is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life.

# Both players start with 3 lives. They lose a life if they mis-answer a question. At the end of every turn, the game should output the new scores for both players, so players know where they stand.

# The game doesn’t end until one of the players loses all their lives. At this point, the game should announce who won and what the other player’s score is.
